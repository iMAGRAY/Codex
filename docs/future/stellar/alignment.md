# Stellar Alignment Brief

## Inputs
- `docs/future/MaxThink-Stellar.md` — requirements blueprint covering REQ-UX-01/02, REQ-ACC-01, REQ-SEC-01/02/03, REQ-PERF-01, REQ-REL-01, REQ-OBS-01, REQ-OPS-01, REQ-DATA-01, REQ-INT-01, REQ-DX-01 (#1–#99).
- `docs/future/stellar-tui-vision.md` — scenario framing for modular TUI platform and phase sequencing.

## Plan: Scenario Confirmation
1. **Operator Incident Triage (REQ-OBS-01, REQ-OPS-01, #8, #20, #23, #45)**
   - Operator navigates Stellar Insight Canvas to inspect telemetry overlay, trigger Debug Orchestrator, and follow inline runbook.
   - Requires keyboard-first navigation plus high-contrast overlay and screen-reader friendly summaries (`REQ-ACC-01`).
2. **SecOps Command Signing & Secrets (REQ-SEC-01/03, #9, #11, #27, #56, #88)**
   - SecOps defines RBAC policies, rotates dynamic secrets, and validates signed command bundles before release.
   - Depends on Secure Command Signing, session timeout banners, and secure clipboard redaction.
3. **SRE Resilience Sweep (REQ-REL-01, REQ-PERF-01, #14, #17, #35, #91)**
   - SRE triggers chaos profile, inspects Local Resilience Cache hit rate, and applies hot patch delivery without downtime.
   - Performance guardrails ensure APDEX ≤ 180 мс and latency p95 ≤ 200 мс.
4. **Platform Engineer Delivery Governance (REQ-OPS-01, REQ-DX-01, #24, #55, #79, #85)**
   - Platform engineer publishes Knowledge Packs through Trusted Pipeline, evaluates Policy Validator findings, and audits Marketplace guardrails.
   - Requires CLI/TUI parity and signed pipeline artifacts (hybrid flow per `stellar-tui-vision.md`).
5. **Partner Developer Integration Bridge (REQ-INT-01, REQ-DATA-01, #13, #15, #42, #67, #82)**
   - Partner developer negotiates transport version, inspects conflict resolver decisions, and publishes analytics widgets to DX toolkit.
   - Needs Zero-Trust Connector with outcome tracking and streaming metrics.

## Plan: RBAC Matrix
| Role | Capabilities | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| Operator | Trigger Insight Canvas, access Observability Mesh overlay, run approved Debug Orchestrator playbooks, view incident timeline snapshots | Read/execute only; inherits accessibility theme presets (REQ-ACC-01, #8, #45). |
| SRE | Manage resilience profiles, edit chaos templates, approve hot patches, configure Incident Timeline exports | Requires dual-control approval for pipeline pushes (REQ-REL-01, REQ-OPS-01, #14, #91). |
| SecOps | Define RBAC guardrails, manage dynamic secrets, sign command bundles, review immutable audit ledger | Elevated access to Secure Signing HSM integration; clipboard redaction enforced (REQ-SEC-01/02/03, #9, #10, #27, #57). |
| Platform Engineer | Operate Trusted Pipeline, curate policy packs, configure governance dashboards, schedule releases | Full pipeline author rights; policy drift alerts routed to this role (REQ-OPS-01, REQ-DX-01, #55, #79, #85). |
| Partner Developer | Submit modules to Marketplace, request sandboxed execution, monitor outcome tracking | Scoped to Zero-Trust Connector endpoints; subject to plugin guardrails (#24, #75, #99). |
| Assistive Tech Bridge | Consume structured telemetry summaries, operate via screen reader commands, toggle high-contrast palettes | Maps to accessibility service account; inherits Operator view with `screen_reader` capability flag (REQ-ACC-01, `stellar-tui-vision.md`). |

## Plan: Assistive Requirements
- Provide screen-reader optimized landmarks, ARIA-like annotations, and queue navigation orders for Insight Canvas (REQ-ACC-01, #6).
- Offer high-contrast theme bundle with palette variants for deuteranopia/protanopia, and ensure autoprefetch respects assistive tech latency (REQ-ACC-01, #62, #87).
- Enable keyboard-only workflows across Command Router, keymap engine, and overlays, including focus outlines and escape hatches (REQ-UX-01, REQ-ACC-01, #1, #2).
- Publish accessibility acceptance checklist aligned with Definition of Done to guarantee regression coverage (`stellar-tui-vision.md` step 3).

## Risks & Clarifications
- Need explicit sign-off from Core, SecOps, SRE, DX squads to confirm capability assignments during Validate phase.
- Baseline APDEX and CSAT values pending instrumentation; to be captured alongside metrics checklist during validation.
