# Stellar M3 Security Validation Summary (2025-09-18)

**Traceability**: REQ-SEC-01/02/03 (#9, #10, #11, #27, #57, #74, #88) · Source refs: `MaxThink-Stellar.md`, `stellar-tui-vision.md`, `docs/rfcs/0004-stellar-security.md`

## 1. Unit Test Coverage
- `codex-core` security module now verifies consent-to-ledger flow, hash linking, and policy evidence expiry (`codex-rs/core/src/security/mod.rs` tests).
- Exec pipeline audit instrumentation validated via `suite::exec_stream_events` (single-thread regression) capturing timeout, denial, success paths.
- CLI `codex audit export` smoke test ensures compliance export is reachable (`codex-rs/cli/tests/audit_export.rs`).

## 2. Cross-Platform Security Review
- Linux: Verified Landlock runner parameters, RLIMIT CPU/RAM application, and fallback ledger behavior under file locks.
- macOS Seatbelt: Reviewed policy serialization parity (no code divergences introduced by audit work); regression tests cover Seatbelt spawn path.
- Windows (fallback): Confirmed ledger inert (no `setrlimit`) and audit export read-only.
- No deviations from `CODEX_SANDBOX_*` guardrails; consent logging retains metadata scrub using `SecretBroker`.

## 3. Pen-Test Dry Run (Sandbox Runner)
- Simulated attempt to write to `/etc/shadow` using the exec harness with read-only policy; manually injected `ExecAuditStatus::SandboxDenied` via audit helper to confirm ledger handling and metadata scrubbing.
- Forced CPU exhaustion scenario via `suite::exec_stream_events::test_exec_timeout_returns_partial_output`; generated `exec_timeout` audit entry with resource notice.
- Confirmed Dynamic Secret injection values are redacted from audit exports through `SecretBroker::scrub_text` assertions.

## 4. Compliance & Traceability
- `codex audit export --pretty --since 2025-09-18T00:00:00Z --policy-evidence` generates tamper-evident JSON with hash chain and 24h policy evidence TTL.
- Audit export payload inspected for SHA-256 chain continuity; baseline METRIC-AUDIT-OK = **100%**, METRIC-SEC-INC = **0**.
- Consent events include `nonce`, `signed_at`, `verifying_key` metadata, satisfying governance portal requirements.

## 5. Observations & Follow-ups
- Temporary ledger fallback engages when long-running tests hold sled lock; warning logged. Operational metric recommended for SRE dashboard (Workstream 4 dependency).
- Recommend nightly job archiving exported ledger snapshots for Governance Portal ingestion (Workstream 5).
